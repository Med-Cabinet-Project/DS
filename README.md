## Code Links

Below are links to resources used to create this project. 

* Datasets (https://github.com/Med-Cabinet-Project/DS/tree/master/web_app/stats_model/csv) 
cannabis.csv is a merged dataframe of both the strains.csv (csv created from the [Strains's API](http://strains.evanbusse.com/)) and the csv from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains). 

* Pickled models (https://github.com/Med-Cabinet-Project/DS/tree/master/web_app/stats_model/pickle_models)
These are the pickled dictionaries used for the home route and the strains route

* API (https://github.com/Med-Cabinet-Project/DS/tree/master/web_app)
This is where the code for creating the different endpoints can be located. 


## Testing
used curl to test that endpoints were able to retrieve correct information 
i.e. curl med-cabinet-project.herokuapp.com/query/pain/depression/happy
